# SimpleText

SimpleText allows you to create 3D text in the world itself. This can be useful for general information, roleplay purposes or just to spice up your world a little. It is currently configured using the `/text` command. The command has multiple sub-commands that can be used by putting a single letter behind the command itself. Just writing `/text` will show you all the commands.

# Features

# Known issues
There are a few issues I'm aware about and that I am planning to fix in future version. Some of which are:
* The text is visible through walls
